# stocks-analysis
* Overview of the Project:
  - The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analysing the total daily volume and the returns of each stock. By using VBA, we can help him to build a easier way of analysing the stock data.
* Results:
  - As clearly shown in the images below, most returns in 2017 are positive (shwon in green), only TERP is showing a negative return (shown in red). While most returns in 2018 are negative, with only 2 stocks that have positive returns. We can conclude that the stock performance in 2017 is way better than that in 2018.
