# **Stocks Analysis**
## Overview of the Project:
  - The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analysing the total daily volume and the returns of each stock. By using VBA, we can help him to build a easier way of analysing the stock data.
## Results:
  - As clearly shown in the images below, most returns in 2017 are positive (shwon in green), only TERP is showing a negative return (shown in red). While most returns in 2018 are negative, with only 2 stocks that have positive returns. We can conclude that the stock performance in 2017 is way better than that in 2018.
  - The refactored code also has a faster ran speed. The refactored code ran in 0.14s for the year 2017 and 0.16s for the year 2018, while the original code ran 0.68s and 0.75s for the year 2017 and 2018.

## Summary:
  ### Pros of refactoring the code:
  - Make the code more efficient. 
  - Reduce the complexity of the code. 
  - Enhance the functionalities.
  ### Cons of refactoring the code:
  - reating bugs.
  - Time consuming
  ### Pros and Cons of the original and refactored VBA script.
  - The refactored script ran faster than the original script.
  - The refactored script didn't use the nested for loop, which is easier and more straightforward to understand. 
  - The refactored script need to write more code lines than the original script and will increase the memory size usage.
  - It will be hrader to deal with more number of iterations when using the rafactored script.
